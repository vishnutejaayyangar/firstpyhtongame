It's just a small ping pong game using python 3. you can download the code and run it in your PC.
Adjust colors, speed of the ball.
(** the ball speed automatically changes when either of the players touches it or drops it
if the ball is dropped the speed is reduced to normal, and the player manages to hit it the speed of ball will increase,
but it also has it's limit for which wxtend the ball speed is increased, otherwise it would just bounce off **)

Hope you like it

For changing the color and shape, just use the code, if you can't ping me I'll solve that.
